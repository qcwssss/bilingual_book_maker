## Critical Security Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| CORS Bypass (`allow_origins=["*"]`) | üî¥ **CRITICAL** | Data theft, CSRF | ‚ùå **MUST FIX** |
| Arbitrary File Upload | üî¥ **CRITICAL** | RCE, malware | ‚ùå **MUST FIX** |
| Path Traversal | üü† **HIGH** | File system access | ‚ùå **MUST FIX** |
| No Authentication | üü† **HIGH** | Unlimited abuse | ‚ùå **MUST FIX** |
| Information Disclosure | üü° **MEDIUM** | System info leak | ‚ùå **SHOULD FIX** |

## Immediate Actions Required

### Before ANY Production Deployment:

1. **Fix CORS Policy**:
   ```python
   # Change from:
   allow_origins=["*"]
   # To:
   allow_origins=["https://yourdomain.com"]
   ```

2. **Implement File Validation**:
   - Validate file content, not just extensions
   - Add file size limits
   - Implement content sanitization

3. **Add Path Sanitization**:
   - Validate and sanitize all file paths
   - Prevent directory traversal attacks

4. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Add API key authentication minimum
   - Rate limiting per user/IP

5. **Remove Debug Information**:
   - Generic error messages for clients
   - Proper logging without sensitive data

## Architecture Strengths

‚úÖ **Good Foundation**:
- Well-designed async architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling framework
- Good progress monitoring system
- Solid unit test coverage

## Development Timeline

### Week 1: Security Hardening
- Fix all critical security vulnerabilities
- Implement basic authentication
- Add input validation framework

### Week 2-3: Reliability & Configuration
- Configuration management system
- Persistent job storage
- Proper logging and monitoring

### Week 4: Production Preparation
- Performance testing
- Deployment documentation
- Security audit validation
